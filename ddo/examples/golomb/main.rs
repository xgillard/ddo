//! This example show how to implement a solver for the Golomb ruler problem using ddo.
//! For more information on this problem https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golomb_ruler
//! This model was introduced by Willem-Jan van Hoeve
//! In this model, each variable/layer is the position of the next mark to be placed.
//! The domain of each variable is the set of all possible positions for the next mark.
//! One can only add a mark if the distance between the new mark and all previous marks
//! is not already present in the set of distances between marks.
//! The cost of a transition is the distance between the new mark and the previous last one.
//! The cost of a solution is thus the position of the last mark.
