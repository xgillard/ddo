//! This module defines the traits used to encapsulate solver heuristics.
//!
//! Namely, it defines :
//!
//!  - the `WidthHeuristic` which is used to control the maximum width of an MDD
//!  - the `StateRanking` heuristic which is used to guess the nodes promisingess
//!  - the `Cutoff` heuristic which is used to impose a stopping criterion on the
//!    solver resolution.

/// This trait enclapsulates the behavior of the heuristic that determines
/// the maximum permitted width of a decision diagram.
///
/// # Technical Note:
/// Just like `Problem`, `Relaxation` and `StateRanking`, the `WidthHeuristic`
/// trait is generic over `State`s. However, rather than using the same 
/// 'assciated-type' mechanism that was used for the former three types, 
/// `WidthHeuristic` uses a parameter type for this purpose (the type parameter
/// approach might feel more familiar to Java or C++ programmers than the 
/// associated-type). 
///
/// This choice was motivated by two factors: 
/// 1. The `Problem`, `Relaxation` and `StateRanking` are intrinsically tied
///    to *one type* of state. And thus, the `State` is really a part of the 
///    problem/relaxation itself. Therefore, it would not make sense to define 
///    a generic problem implementation which would be applicable to all kind 
///    of states. Instead, an implementation of the `Problem` trait is the
///    concrete implementation of a DP model (same argument holds for the other 
///    traits). 
///
/// 2. On the other hand, it does make sense to define a `WidthHeuristic` 
///    implementation which is applicable regardless of the state of the problem
///    which is currently being solved. For instance, the ddo framework offers
///    the `Fixed` and `NbUnassigned` width heuristics which are independent of
///    the problem. The `Fixed` width heuristic imposes that the maxumum layer
///    width be constant accross all compiled DDs whereas `NbUnassigned` lets
///    the maximum width vary depending on the number of problem variables 
///    which have already been decided upon.
pub trait WidthHeuristic<State> {
    /// Estimates a good maximum width for an MDD rooted in the given state
    fn max_width(&self, state: &SubProblem<State>) -> usize;
}

/// A state ranking is an heuristic that imposes a partial order on states.
/// This order is used by the framework as a means to discriminate the most
/// promising nodes from the least promising ones when restricting or relaxing
/// a layer from some given DD.
/// 
/// According to this ordering, greater means better and hence more likely to
/// means a node with a given state is more likely to be kept after restriction
/// or relaxation.

    /// As is the case for `Problem` and `Relaxation`, a `StateRanking` must 
    /// tell the kind of states it is able to operate on.

    /// desirable to keep. In this ordering, 
    fn compare(&self, value_a: isize, state_a: &Self::State, value_b: isize, b: &Self::State) -> Ordering;
}

/// A subproblem ranking is an heuristic that imposes a partial order on
/// subproblems on the solver fringe. This order is used by the framework 
/// as a means to impose a given ordering on the nodes that are popped from
/// the solver fringe.
pub trait SubProblemRanking {
    /// As is the case for `Problem` and `Relaxation`, a `SubProblemRanking` 
    /// must tell the kind of states it is able to operate on.

    /// that needs to be popped off the fringe first. In this ordering, greater

/// to stop searching for a better solution. Typically, this is done to grant
