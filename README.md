DDO is a truly generic framework to develop MDD-based combinatorial optimization 
solvers in  [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). Its goal is to let you describe 
your optimization problem as a dynamic program along with a relaxation. 

When the dynamic program of the problem is considered as a transition system, 
the relaxation serves the purpose of merging different nodes of the transition 
system into an other node standing for them all. In that setup, the sole 
condition to ensure the correctness of the optimization algorithm is that the 
replacement node must be an over approximation of all what is feasible from the 
merged nodes.

***Bonus:***
As a side benefit from using `ddo`, you will be able to exploit all of your
hardware to solve your optimization in parallel.

## Setup
This library is written in stable rust (1.41 at the time of writing). Therefore, 
it should be compiled with [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/index.html) 
the rust package manager (installed with your rust toolchain). Thanks to it, 
compiling and using ddo will be a breeze no matter the platform you are working 
on.

Once you have a rust tool chain installed, using ddo is as simple as adding it
as a dependency to your Cargo.toml file and building your project.

```toml
[dependencies]
ddo = "0.1.0"
```

## Simplistic yet complete example
The following example illustrates what it takes to build a complete solver based
on DDO for the [binary knapsack problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem#0-1_knapsack_problem).

The first step is always to describe the optimization problem you try to solve
in terms of a dynamic program. And then, you should also provide a relaxation
for the problem. 

From this description of the problem, ddo will derive an MDD which it will use 
to find an optimal solution to your problem. However, for a reasonably sized 
problem, expanding the complete state space in memory would not be tractable. 
Therefore, you should also provide ddo with a *relaxation*. In this context, 
the relaxation means a strategy to merge several nodes of the MDD, so as to 
make a fake node that is an over approximation of all the merged nodes (state + 
longest path, where the longest path is the value of the objective function you
try to optimize).  

### Describe the problem as dynamic program
```rust
/// Describe the binary knapsack problem in terms of a dynamic program.
/// Here, the state of a node, is nothing more than an unsigned integer (usize).
/// That unsigned integer represents the remaining capacity of our sack.
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct Knapsack {
    capacity: usize,
    profit  : Vec<usize>,
    weight  : Vec<usize>
}
impl Problem<usize> for Knapsack {
    fn nb_vars(&self) -> usize {
        self.profit.len()
    }
    fn domain_of<'a>(&self, state: &'a usize, var: Variable) ->Domain<'a> {
        if *state >= self.weight[var.id()] {
            vec![0, 1].into()
        } else {
            vec![0].into()
        }
    }
    fn initial_state(&self) -> usize {
        self.capacity
    }
    fn initial_value(&self) -> i32 {
        0
    }
    fn transition(&self, state: &usize, _vars: &VarSet, dec: Decision) -> usize {
        state - (self.weight[dec.variable.id()] * dec.value as usize)
    }
    fn transition_cost(&self, _state: &usize, _vars: &VarSet, dec: Decision) -> i32 {
        self.profit[dec.variable.id()] as i32 * dec.value
    }
}
```

### Provide a relaxation for the problem
```rust
/// Merge the nodes by creating a new fake node that has the maximum remaining
/// capacity from the merged nodes and the maximum objective value (intuitiveley,
/// it keeps the best state, and the best value for the objective function).
#[derive(Debug, Clone)]
struct KPRelax;
impl Relaxation<usize> for KPRelax {
    fn merge_nodes(&self, nodes: &[Node<usize>]) -> Node<usize> {
        let lp_info = nodes.iter()
            .map(|n| &n.info)
            .max_by_key(|i| i.lp_len).unwrap();
        let max_capa= nodes.iter()
            .map(|n| n.state)
            .max().unwrap();
        Node::merged(max_capa, lp_info.lp_len, lp_info.lp_arc.clone())
    }
}
```

### Solve the problem
```rust
/// Then instantiate a solver and spawn as many threads as there are hardware
/// threads on the machine to solve the problem.
fn main() {
    let problem = Knapsack {
        capacity: 50,
        profit  : vec![60, 100, 120],
        weight  : vec![10,  20,  30]
    };
    let mdd = mdd_builder(&problem, KPRelax).build();
    let mut solver = ParallelSolver::new(mdd);
    let (optimal, solution) = solver.maximize();

    assert_eq!(220, optimal);
    println!("Solution");
    for decision in solution.as_ref().unwrap() {
        if decision.value == 1 {
            println!("{}", decision.variable.id());
        }
    }
}
```

## Building the more advanced examples (companion binaries)
The source code of the above (simplistic) example is provided in the examples
section of this project. Meanwhile, the examples provide an implementation for
more advanced solvers. Namely, it provides an implementation for: 
  + [Maximum Independent Set Problem (MISP)](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Independent_set_(graph_theory))
  + [Maximum 2 Satisfiability (MAX2SAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_satisfiability_problem)
  + [Maximum Cut Problem (MCP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_cut)
  + Unbounded Knapsack 

These are again compiled with cargo with the following command:
```cargo build --release --all-targets```. Once the compilation completes, you
will find the desired binaries at : 
  + $project/target/release/examples/knapsack
  + $project/target/release/examples/max2sat
  + $project/target/release/examples/mcp
  + $project/target/release/examples/misp
 
If you have any question regarding the use of these programs, just to `<program> -h`
and it should display an helpful message explaining you how to use it.

### Note 
The implementation of MISP, MAX2SAT and MCP correspond to the formulation and
relaxation proposed by [Bergman et al](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/ijoc.2015.0648).
